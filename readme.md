#Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm
####Built by Aneesh Bhatnagar

The program takes in the input via a file named input.txt and outputs the minimum spanning tree of the provided graph to the output.txt file. 

For this project, the following things were implemented:

* Heap Data Structure in Python
* Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm in Python
